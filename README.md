# Doom Unity  
A passionate recreation of the classic [Doom (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) built from scratch using the Unity engine. This project aims to capture the feel of the original game while modernizing its structure.

## Engine  
Built with [Unity 2022.3.55f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.55).  

## About the Project  
This is a personal project to dive deeper into game development, understand what made Doom a timeless classic, and bring it to life with a modern engine. The goal isn't to create a 1:1 replica but to stay true to its essenceâ€”fast-paced gameplay, iconic visuals, and a nostalgic soundtrack.  

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback!
